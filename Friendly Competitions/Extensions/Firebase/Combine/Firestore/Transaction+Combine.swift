    ///  outside of this transaction since being read, then the transaction will be retried by
    ///  executing the updateBlock again. If the transaction still fails after 5 retries, then the
    ///   transaction will fail.

    /// Since the updateBlock may be executed multiple times, it should avoiding doing anything that
    /// would cause side effects.

    /// Any value maybe be returned from the updateBlock. If the transaction is successfully
    /// committed, then the completion block will be passed that value. The updateBlock also has an
    ///  `Error` out parameter. If this is set, then the transaction will not attempt to commit, and
    ///  the given error will be passed to the completion block.

    /// The `Transaction` object passed to the updateBlock contains methods for accessing documents
    ///  and collections. Unlike other firestore access, data accessed with the transaction will not
    ///  reflect local changes that have not been committed. For this reason, it is required that
    ///  all reads are performed before any writes. Transactions must be performed while online.
    ///  Otherwise, reads will fail, the final commit will fail, and the completion block will
    ///  return an error.
